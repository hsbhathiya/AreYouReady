Associated Battery Manufacturers (Ceylon) Limited (ABM) is the largest manufacturer of Lead Acid Batteries in Sri Lanka. ABM was established in 1960 in technical collaboration with British Batteries, and emerged as a blue-chip company due to the high quality products manufactured. Currently we maintain No.1 position in Sri Lanka while exporting batteries to several countries.

ABM produces both “dry charged” and “maintenance free” batteries under the well recognized brand names “ Exide, “Lucas” and “Degenite”. In addition to the automotive and motor-cycle lead acid batteries, ABM also produces deep cycle batteries for solar systems. Deep cycle batteries are produced to suit the tropical climate for trouble free use as they are used in remote villages. Few years back, ABM entered into the international market exporting batteries. The export statistics increased gradually year by year. The performance of ABM in the last few years has been remarkable. As an appreciation for this commendable performance, the company has been widely recognized by the community.
